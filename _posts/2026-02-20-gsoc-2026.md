QEMU is participating in [Google Summer of
Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) once again! Google Summer of Code
is an open source internship program with internships running May through
August. Would you like to experience contributing to an open source project?
This paid remote work internship opportunity is a great way to get involved!

Interns work with experienced QEMU developers who mentor them during the
internship. Code is submitted through the same open source process that all
QEMU developers follow. This gives interns experience with contributing to open
source software.

ideas](https://wiki.qemu.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_2026) and see if there is

questions you may have and discuss the idea further.
